# Snakemake8x_slurm_example

With the introduction of Snakemake8 the slurm and cluster-config has changed drastically so that old snakemake 7.x and older workflows do not work anymore. This is a minimal example on how to setup a new workflow. Further, I try to establish a best practise for configuring such a workflow (in the sense of best practise for me, what I find most intuitively to use).
